    "# Part 2: Link Prediction on a Knowledge Graph\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "Link prediction is the task of predicting missing connections (or links) between two nodes in a (directed) graph. By convention, we call those two nodes the subject $s$ and the object $o$. In most of the cases, we are considering typed edges which means that the edges (ie the relations) have a label, noted as $r$. An example triplet in the context of social networks could be $\\Big(s=\"John Doe\", r=\"follows\", o=\"Karen Smith\"\\Big)$. Link prediction is as the heart of many applications with Knowledge Graphs (KG). For instance, link prediction can be used to propose to a user to connect/follow another one.\n",
    "\n",
    "In this hands-on tutorial, we propose to play with the FB15k-237 dataset.  This dataset contains textual  relations  that were extracted  from  200  million  sentences  in  the  ClueWeb12  corpus  coupled  with Freebase mention annotations and include textual links of all co-occurring entities from the KB set. The FB15k-237 dataset has 15'000 nodes and 272'000 edges. 17'000 are used for validation and 20'000 are used for testing. \n",
    "\n",
    "## Objectives:\n",
    "\n",
    "- Sharpen your understanding of Graph Neural Networks with the R-GCN model \n",
    "- Use the high-level API of the DGL library \n",
    "- Train a link prediction task: predicting missing links in a Knowledge Graph (KG)\n",
    "\n",
    "Disclaimer: This hands-on exercise is inspired by the official DGL tutorial introducing the Relational-Graph Convolutional Network (R-GCN) available [here](https://github.com/dmlc/dgl/tree/master/examples/pytorch/rgcn) ."
